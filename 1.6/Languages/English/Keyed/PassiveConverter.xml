        LEARNING NOTE: Translation / Localization Files
    
        RimWorld uses XML files for all text that appears in-game.
        This allows easy translation to other languages!
    
        STRUCTURE:
        - Languages/English/ = English translation
        - Languages/French/ = French translation (if you add it)
        - Keyed/ = text referenced by key in code
        - DefInjected/ = text that replaces Def fields
    
        HOW IT WORKS:
        In code: "SomeKey".Translate()
        RimWorld looks up "SomeKey" in this file
        Returns the translated text
    
        PARAMETERS:
        You can use {0}, {1}, etc. for parameters
        Example: "Converting {0} {1}" where {0}=amount, {1}=material name
      -->

    <!-- UI strings for passive converter inspect panel -->

    <!-- Not currently used (handled inline) but kept for future use --><PassiveConverterProgress>Converting: {0} {1} ({2}% complete)
    </PassiveConverterProgress><PassiveConverterTimeRemaining>Time remaining: {0}
    </PassiveConverterTimeRemaining><PassiveConverterIdle>Idle - awaiting materials
    </PassiveConverterIdle>

    <!-- Messages shown to player -->

    <!-- Not currently used (handled inline) but kept for consistency --><PassiveConversionComplete>Finished converting {0} {1} into {2} {3}.
    </PassiveConversionComplete><PassiveConversionCanceled>Passive conversion canceled. Materials refunded.
    </PassiveConversionCanceled>

    <!-- Gizmo (button) text -->

    <!-- Not currently used (handled inline) but kept for future localization --><CancelPassiveConversion>Cancel Conversion
    </CancelPassiveConversion><CancelPassiveConversionDesc>Stop the current conversion and refund materials.
    </CancelPassiveConversionDesc><NoMaterials>No materials available for active process
    </NoMaterials><AlreadyFinished>Processor is already finished. Empty it first.
    </AlreadyFinished><ProcessorNotFinished>Processor cycle not complete
    </ProcessorNotFinished><TextMote_ProductWasted>Product Wasted
</TextMote_ProductWasted>

    <!--
        NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
    
        The strings above are defined but not currently used in the code.
        The code uses inline strings for simplicity in this version.
    
        TO USE THESE STRINGS IN CODE:
        Instead of: "Converting {amount} {material}"
        Use: "PassiveConverterProgress".Translate(amount, material, percent)
    
        BENEFITS OF USING KEYS:
        - Easy to translate to other languages
        - Change text without recompiling code
        - Consistent wording across mod
    
        DRAWBACK:
        - Slightly more complex code
        - Need to remember key names
    
        For now, keeping these as placeholders for future localization.
